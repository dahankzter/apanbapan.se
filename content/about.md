Apanbapan, or _Monkey Bonkey_ in english, tries to describe how I want the tone of this blog to be.
At this point I don't know what that actually means but somewhere between _batshit crazy_ and _moderatly serious_
is what I am aiming for.

Daily, out of the bat suit, I am a software developer working for a startup in the _big data_ database area.
My publishings and thoughts here are my own but sometimes they will concern my work since I work with some
seriously skilled people and I just want to brag about it! Stay tuned for more on this!

I hack privately over on [Github](https://github.com/dahankzter) and you can reach me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dahankzter) as well.
