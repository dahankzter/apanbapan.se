Putting up this site has been on my todo list for a very long time.
I could always find a reason to procrastinate getting started and for the most part
they were actually reasonable and valid reasons. I have always wanted to blog regularly
because I think that occasionally I actually have something to say that others
might find valuable. There will be a lot of tech and programming related posts I expect.
There will also be the occasional sejour into Agile and what I belive it still stands for
in the context of software development as well as other areas.
There can be the occasional political post as well concerning such things as diversity in tech,
democracy and liberalism since these are all areas that are close to me.
